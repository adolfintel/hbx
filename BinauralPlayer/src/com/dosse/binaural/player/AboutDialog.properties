However, some individuals may have seizures. For this reason, if you have any familiar who suffers from epilepsy or similar conditions, you should consult your medic before using this software.<br><br><b>How can I use these binaural beats?</b><br>All you need are decent stereo headphones, and some peace and quiet while you're listening to the preset: if something interrupts you, the effect of the beats will wear off almost immediately.<br>Once you made sure that nobody can nag you, put on your headphones, get comfortable, press play and focus on the beats. Do not get scared from the sensations that the beats may cause, or you will "wake up" and have to do that all over. It may take some practice.<br>You can get some presets here for free: http://hbx.fdossena.com/presets_pc.html<br><b>WARNING:</b> Binaural beats may cause seizures to some people.<br><br><b>License</b><br> HBX Binaural Player is made using libBinaural (Free java binaural  beats library) by dosse91 (dossenus91@gmail.com).<br> Both this and libBinaural are free software and are released under the GNU GPL License agreement available at  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html<br> You are legally free to use, modify and/or redistribute this software as long as you give credit to its authors and include this disclaimer.<br> Some icons used in this application come from http://icons8.com/ and are under  the Creative Commons license agreement available here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/<br>The Open Sans font included with this application is property of Steve Matteson and is under Apache License, version 2.0 available here: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html<br>The Bitstream Vera Sans font included with this application is distributed under this copyright: http://www-old.gnome.org/fonts/#Final_Bitstream_Vera_Fonts<br><b>This software comes with ABSOLUTELY no warranty, implicit or explicit.<br> YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THE APPLICATION.</b><br> <br> <b>Need help?</b><br>Just send me an e-mail at dossenus91@gmail.com and I'll answer as soon as possible.</html>
